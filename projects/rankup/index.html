problem: 'The main problem with the other games were:
<div>1. Difficult game to play for the average user. Excluding the vast majority that would have wanted to play.</div>
<div>2. Old fashioned UI and not reliable app with many errors. It was almost only possible to play on desktop.</div>
<div>3. For the game to be enjoyable the user needed to play everyday. If the user missed one day, the user would‚Äôve already been at a disadvantage. This was exhausting for almost all types of players.</div>'
motivation: 'I started playing fantasy football games when I was 12 years old and I loved it. There was always a huge gap for improvement.
My goal was to build a very easy game with a clear intuitive UI that would work on all types of devices where all types of players were included. From the player who loves this type of game and spends day after day thinking about how to do better, to the one who plays for fun to play with its family and friends.
With this in mind, I knew what I had to do to build a game that players would love.'
process: 'As soon as I started, my goal was to build a MVP and pass it to a close group with diverse types of players so I could gain understanding about what they do like, what they don‚Äôt, what they‚Äôre missing, and whether they find it fun and easy to play. Overall, if they were having a great user experience and time while playing. For example, I was very nit-picky with the matches scoreboard inputs functionality and UI. It had to be very very clear and appealing for the players. It was a crucial feature, the player could spend hours and hours in this view each week so I always thought about making it better and better.
The closed group really liked it and continued playing so I decided to expand it to different groups before the final version. My deadline was to release it 2 months before the World Cup 2018.'
results: 'When I released it before the World Cup 2018, as I didn‚Äôt have money to advertise it properly, all users that had known about Rankup was because of word-of-mouth so I decided to spend time advertising it on forums. At this time, I knew Rankup was a successful game because there were already groups playing it and they were loving it. Just before the World Cup kicked out, there were 1390 players and 186 tournaments created, the success surprised me.
There were 70% customer retention until the end of the World Cup and players were completely engaged on Rankup. For example, every time there was a goal during the World Cup, hundreds of users connected simultaneously to see their score and how they were doing. The peak was in one game of the semifinals with 324 players at the same time when France scored.'
