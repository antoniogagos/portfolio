situation: "Carmen is an interior designer that operates mainly online. The problem she detected was that 4 out of 5 new customers discovered her through word of mouth. The impact of her site was practically nil.
I realised that her site had critical errors:
<div>1. The user-centric performance metrics scored really really bad. For example, the largest contentful paint occurred at 5 seconds and the cumulative layout shift because of images with unknown dimensions was exhausting.</div>
<div>2. The UI could be improved drastically. For example, it had low contrast between almost all interface elements. Lack of text hierarchy with very very long paragraphs. Using irrelevant and low-quality images across the site, among others.</div>
<div>3. Her personal branding was obsolete and not trustworthy for clients. You didn’t know you were on Carmen’s site unless you scrolled to the footer. It seemed like Carmen was afraid to show her work and her own style.</div>"
task: "After analysing all of this with Carmen and knowing what she wanted. I started building it. The main goal was to build a beautiful site infused with Carmen’s style that will work across all devices at fast lightning speed making a great user experience. So when potential customers visit her site they know at first glance that they are at Carmen de la Lama site, making them feel like they are visiting Carmen's house and she's showing you what she has done, her projects, generating that necessary confidence between her and her customers."
results: "The lighthouse report metrics are excellent, scoring 386 out of 400 for Performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO metrics.After going live with the new site, Carmen started to get more attraction from new clients. Two months after, I contacted her and told me that she had boosted her total sales 37% and she was getting clients for foreign countries. I told her that maybe it was a good moment to translate it to English too but she told me that she wasn’t comfortable working with clients that doesn’t speak her native language. We concluded that maybe we could do it in the near future…!"
