    <div style="font-weight: 100;">
      I've been working professionally as a designer since 2008, but I've been passionate about design waaaay longer than that. I remember getting my first PC at the age of 10 and promptly breaking it as soon as I tried to make a custom Windows 95 theme (PSA: don't mess with .ini files, kids).
      Since then, I've been privileged and fortunate enough to work on really cool problems in new fields of design and technology with amazing people who are way, way smarter than me.
